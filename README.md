# 64-bit Content Addressable Memory

## Hello!

I am a Raleigh, NC based engineer with RF semiconductor fabrication experience reskilling for a logic-focused career path via graduate ASIC design & verification coursework at NC State.

Below is a class-assigned project from ECE546 VLSI Design Systems. All input is much appreciated.  Thank you!

## Project Summary

Output: Design a 64-bit Content Addressable Memory (CAM).

Purpose: Build understanding content addressable memory architecture, optimize design for delay, energy and area.

Tools: Synopsys Custom Compiler

## Milestone #1 - Due 3/28
(In progress)
-Review of design options to be explored (logic styles and circuit topologies for bit-cells, decoders and flipflops)
-First pass floor plan

3/25 Draft planning diagrams for data+control signals:
